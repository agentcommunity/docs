# Welcome to the .agent Community

*Build the agentic future, together.*

Agents are exploding across the web, but the ecosystem is scattered. There is no common home for open standards, shared trust signals, or ethical guardâ€‘rails. .agent community is here to fix that.

## Our Mission

The Agent Community is an open, nonâ€‘commercial home where builders, researchers, and operators:

* Coâ€‘create **open standards** for discovery, auth, and capability exchange.
* Draft and uphold a **humanâ€‘centric Terms and Conditions** that bans harmful use.
* Secure the **.agent** Topâ€‘Level Domain as a shared namespace that signals trust.
* Share tools, examples, and best practices in the open.

## How You Can Help

1. **[Join](https://agentcommunity.org)** â€“ become a member and get early access to .agent domains. _(Join with your company!)_
2. **[Invite](https://agentcommunity.org)** â€“ share your personal link, earn points, and grow the ecosystem.
3. **[Contribute](https://github.com/orgs/agentcommunity)** â€“ comment. review, and propose new ideas.
4. **Build** â€“ ship agents, get feedback and and wear the .agent badge.

### First Work Item: Agent Interface Discovery (AID)

Our starting task is **AID**, a lightweight DNSâ€‘based protocol that lets any client discover an agent's endpoint and config with a single query. AID wipes out the "where is the API" problem and lays the groundwork for richer registry services.

## Community vs Registrar: Who Does What

| Platform               | Role                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AgentCommunity.org** | Community, standards, governance, education            |
| **AgentDomain.xyz**    | Future registrar portal for registering .agent domains |



## The Gap We Are Closing

Today agent developers face:

* **Trust** â€“ anyone can spin up an endpoint, but users cannot tell if it is safe or honest.
* **Discovery** â€“ there is no simple way to locate an agent's API or capabilities from its domain.
* **Interoperability** â€“ competing schemas fragment the ecosystem and slow adoption.
* **Ethics** â€“ few shared norms keep agents aligned with human interests.
* **Voice** â€“ decisions often rest with big platforms, not with the builders on the ground.
