# AID 1.1 change overview: identity joins discovery

**TL;DR:** AID 1.1 keeps the one-record discovery model and adds optional endpoint proof. You can still type a domain and connect. Now you can also verify you are talking to the right agent. We added a pragmatic `.well-known` fallback and small metadata keys. No breaking changes.

## What changed

* **PKA (Public Key for Agent):** Domains can publish a public key in `_agent.<domain>`. Clients send a small challenge, the server signs, the client verifies. This proves endpoint control.
* **`.well-known` fallback:** If DNS updates are slow, clients may read JSON at `https://<domain>/.well-known/agent`. DNS stays canonical.
* **Metadata and aliases:** Short keys (`v, p, u, s, a, d, e, k, i`) keep records compact. Optional `docs` and `dep` improve operator UX and safe migrations.
* **Protocol tokens expanded:** `grpc`, `graphql`, `websocket`, and `zeroconf` join `mcp`, `a2a`, `openapi`, and `local`.

## What stayed the same

* **Scope:** AID is still a minimal bootstrap. It discovers where and how to connect. It is not a capability registry or an auth system.
* **DNS-first:** One TXT record at `_agent.<domain>` remains the standard path. Clients respect TTL. DNSSEC is recommended.
* **Backward compatibility:** All valid v1.0 records continue to work.

## Why this matters to builders

* **Stronger trust with little work:** Add PKA for sensitive planes. Rotate keys with `kid`. Clients can warn on downgrade.
* **Lower friction in real orgs:** `.well-known` helps teams who cannot touch DNS quickly. DNS remains the source of truth.
* **Multi-protocol future:** Same discovery for MCP, A2A, gRPC, GraphQL, or WebSocket.

## Migration notes

* You do not need to change existing records.
* When ready, add `k` and `i` for PKA, plus `d` for docs and `e` for deprecation timelines.
* Consider publishing protocol-specific subdomains if you run multiple agent entry points.

## Whatâ€™s next

* Planned v2 uses SRV/HTTPS records with the same `_agent` service label.
* Community registries track tokens and public adoption.
