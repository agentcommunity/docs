# Announcing AID: identity for the agentic web

**TL;DR (ELI5):** Type a domain to find its agent, then prove it’s the real one with a quick key-based check.  
> Simple. Trusted. Works today.

## The idea in one sentence

AID is the internet’s address book for agents. Give it a domain, get the right agent endpoint, and optionally verify it with a lightweight cryptographic proof.

## What it solves

* **No discovery glue:** Stop hard-coding endpoints or hunting through docs. One record tells clients where to connect and which protocol to speak.
* **Trust at first contact:** Optional identity proof confirms the server controls the key the domain published. Clear signal for security teams.
* **Works across stacks:** MCP, A2A, gRPC, GraphQL, WebSocket. Same discovery, different protocols.
* **Pragmatic in real orgs:** DNS is ideal. If you cannot touch DNS this week, serve a `.well-known/agent` file while you line up the change.

## Why adopt now

* **Faster integrations:** Any compliant client can discover and connect to your agent automatically.
* **Clear security posture:** Turn on key-based proof for admin or high-trust paths. Rotate keys without breaking clients.
* **Better UX out of the box:** Add a short description, a docs link, and deprecation timelines. Clients can guide users before they connect.

## What you can expect

* **Minimal surface area:** One TXT record. Optional identity.
* **No central registry:** If you control a domain, you can publish today.
* **Stable path forward:** The `_agent` label carries into future versions and tooling.
