----------------------------------------------------

AI agents are getting good at using tools. The next bottleneck is not intelligence, it is integration.

This week, Google published an early preview of **WebMCP**, a proposal to let websites expose structured tools directly to browser agents. ([Chrome for Developers][1])

If you are building for the agentic web, WebMCP is worth paying attention to.

It also highlights a key distinction in the emerging stack:

* **WebMCP is browser-first.**
* **AID is Internet-first.**

Both matter, and they fit together cleanly.

## I — What WebMCP is actually trying to do

WebMCP proposes a browser API that lets a web app register “tools” as JavaScript functions with schemas and natural language descriptions. ([Web Machine Learning][2])

Conceptually, it is:

* a page registers tools with the browser (`navigator.modelContext`)
* an agent can invoke those tools instead of guessing clicks and scraping DOM

Google’s announcement frames this as making websites “agent-ready” with structured interactions, including both declarative (HTML-form friendly) and imperative (JavaScript) approaches. ([Chrome for Developers][1])

The punchline: **WebMCP is about reliable interaction once an agent is already inside a webpage.**

## II — What AID is trying to do

AID answers a different question:

> Given a domain, where is the agent and which protocol should I speak?

AID is DNS-first discovery via `_agent.<domain>`.

That matters because the “agentic web” is not only websites. Plenty of agent endpoints are:

* MCP servers
* A2A endpoints
* UCP endpoints
* pure APIs
* gateways
* commerce endpoints
* local agents you run via a package reference

AID stays Internet-native by design because **DNS is the common substrate**. It does not require the endpoint to be a website, or even to have a human-facing UI.

## III — Browser-first vs Internet-first

Here is the practical distinction:

### WebMCP is browser-first

WebMCP requires a webpage context because tools are registered by page JavaScript, via a browser API. ([Web Machine Learning][2])

That is a feature, not a flaw. It makes WebMCP great for:

* agent workflows that happen inside logged-in sessions
* user-in-the-loop actions
* websites that want a cleaner “agent integration surface” than raw DOM actuation ([Chrome for Developers][1])

### AID is Internet-first

AID works from a domain name alone, before any browsing happens.

That makes AID useful for:

* agents that start from a domain string (typed, copied, scanned, shared)
* endpoints that are not websites
* discovery in environments where there is no browser at all (server agents, CLI agents, local tools)

Both assumptions are true in practice:

* Yes, many agents will land on webpages.
* Also yes, many agents will never touch a webpage and still need discovery.

The stack needs both.

## IV — How these fit together with MCP

WebMCP explicitly frames pages as being “like MCP servers” that implement tools in client-side script. ([Web Machine Learning][2])

That lines up with the broader MCP direction: MCP standardizes how tools and context are exposed between hosts, clients, and servers using a consistent protocol. ([Model Context Protocol][3])

A clean, composable flow looks like this:

1. **AID discovers an endpoint from a domain**

   * `_agent.example.com` → `p=mcp; u=https://api.example.com/mcp`
2. **Agent connects via MCP (or another protocol)**
3. **If the workflow enters a website**

   * the site can expose WebMCP tools to the browser agent for higher precision actions

AID gets you to the right place. WebMCP helps you act reliably once you are there.

## V — Why this matters now

What WebMCP signals is simple:

Websites are starting to treat “agents as users” and want a first-class interface for them. ([Chrome for Developers][1])

That is good news for the ecosystem.

It also reinforces a core AID thesis:

If agents are going to navigate the Internet as participants, they need a neutral, universal, low-friction way to resolve domains into agent endpoints.

That is what DNS is for.

## VI — Practical guidance

If you build a website and want agents to take actions inside it:

* Watch WebMCP, prototype when you can, and design your “tool surface” intentionally.

If you operate an agent endpoint, API, gateway, or service:

* Publish AID records so any agent can discover you from your domain, without relying on a central registry or a specific browser.

The agentic web will be multi-runtime by default.
Browser-first tools and Internet-first discovery are complementary layers.
