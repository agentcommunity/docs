# Get Involved

## Four ways to participate

### 1. Join the community

Register at [agentcommunity.org](https://agentcommunity.org) to become a founding member. No fees, no binding contracts. You get:

- Priority `.agent` reservation windows (non-binding)
- Policy voting rights
- Working group access
- Recognition as a founding supporter

### 2. Contribute to specs

The [Agent Identity & Discovery (AID)](https://aid.agentcommunity.org) spec is our first work item — a DNS-based protocol for agent discovery. It's open source and we need feedback:

- **Review the spec** at [aid.agentcommunity.org](https://aid.agentcommunity.org)
- **File issues** on [GitHub](https://github.com/agentcommunity)
- **Submit PRs** — SDKs, reference implementations, documentation improvements
- **Test it** — implement AID for your agents and report what works and what doesn't

### 3. Join working groups

Active groups you can join today:

- **Discovery** — AID protocol, DNS resolution, endpoint standards
- **Verification** — trust signals, authentication, reputation
- **Safety** — abuse prevention, content policy, disputes
- **Tooling** — SDKs (TypeScript, Go, Python), developer experience

Reach out on Discord or email [collab@agentcommunity.org](mailto:collab@agentcommunity.org) to join a group.

### 4. Spread the word

The stronger the community roster, the stronger the case for community-governed `.agent`. Share with your team, your network, your org.
