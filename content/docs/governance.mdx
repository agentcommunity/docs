# Governance

## Builders set the rules

The .agent community is designed so the people building and using agents decide how the namespace works — not a single company's board.

Every policy, standard, and safety guideline goes through community process. No backroom deals, no unilateral changes.

## How decisions get made

### Working groups

Focused teams that own specific areas. Anyone can join. Current groups:

| Group | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Discovery** | AID spec, DNS-based agent resolution, protocol design |
| **Verification** | Trust signals, agent authentication, reputation systems |
| **Safety** | Abuse prevention, content policies, dispute resolution |
| **Tooling** | SDKs, reference implementations, developer experience |

Working groups propose standards. The community reviews and ratifies them.

### Community ballots

Major decisions go to a vote:

- **Registration policies** — who can get a `.agent` name, pricing tiers, reserved names
- **Safety standards** — what agents must comply with to keep their name
- **Dispute resolution** — how conflicts over names get resolved
- **Grant allocation** — how community funds support open source work

### Transparent process

- All proposals are public on [GitHub](https://github.com/agentcommunity)
- Discussion happens in the open — GitHub Discussions and [Discord](https://discord.gg/agentcommunity)
- Meeting notes are published
- Voting records are public

## Community vs. registrar

Two separate roles, by design:

| | Role |
|---|---|
| **agentcommunity.org** | Governance, standards, working groups, policy |
| **Registrar (future)** | Technical operations — DNS, registration portal, billing |

The community sets the rules. The registrar executes them. This separation ensures operational decisions don't override community policy.

## Founding membership

Early members get a direct role in shaping `.agent` before it launches:

- **Policy voting rights** — vote on standards and registration rules
- **Working group access** — join task forces on discovery, verification, safety
- **Priority reservation windows** — signal the names you want before general availability
- **Public recognition** — founding supporters are credited in ICANN filings and community showcases

No fees. No binding contracts. Just participation.
