# The agentic web needs shared infrastructure

Agents are shipping fast. They handle support, schedule meetings, negotiate deals, and coordinate across systems. But the ecosystem is fragmented — no shared naming, no discovery standard, no community governance.

That's a problem. Without common infrastructure, one platform will own the layer between agents and the internet. When that happens, everyone else plays by their rules.

**We're building the alternative.** An open, community-governed foundation for agent identity, discovery, and trust.

## The gap right now

| Problem | What it means |
|---------|--------------|
| **No naming layer** | Agents are anonymous IDs. No brand, no accountability, no trust signal. |
| **No discovery standard** | Every platform invents its own way to find agents. Fragmentation slows adoption. |
| **No community governance** | Rules about agent identity are being set by platforms, not by builders. |
| **No shared trust** | Users can't tell a legitimate agent from a malicious one. |

## Who we are

Developers, researchers, AI labs, and companies — shaping the rules together. No single corporation decides who gets a name or how the system works.
