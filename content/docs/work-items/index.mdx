# Work Items

Active specifications and protocols under development.

## Agent Identity & Discovery (AID)

A lightweight DNS-based protocol that lets any client discover an agent's endpoint, capabilities, and config with a single query. AID is the foundation for agent discoverability on the open web.

**Status:** v1 specification published, SDKs in development.

### What AID solves

| Problem | AID solution |
|---------|-------------|
| "Where is the API?" | DNS TXT record points to agent config |
| "What can this agent do?" | Structured capability declaration in `aid.json` |
| "Is this agent legitimate?" | Tied to domain ownership — DNS proves control |
| "How do I call it?" | Endpoint, auth method, and protocol in one place |

### Get involved

## Future work items

The community is scoping additional specifications. Areas under discussion:

- **Agent verification** — trust signals and reputation beyond DNS
- **Inter-agent protocols** — standards for agent-to-agent communication
- **Safety frameworks** — shared norms for agent behavior and accountability
