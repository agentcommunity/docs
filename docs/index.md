# Welcome to the .agent Community

*Build the agentic future, together.*

Agents are exploding across the web, but the ecosystem is scattered. There is no common home for open standards, shared trust signals, or ethical guard‑rails. .agent community is here to fix that.

## Our Mission

The Agent Community is an open, non‑commercial home where builders, researchers, and operators:

* Co‑create **open standards** for discovery, auth, and capability exchange.
* Draft and uphold a **human‑centric Terms and Conditions** that bans harmful use.
* Secure the **.agent** Top‑Level Domain as a shared namespace that signals trust.
* Share tools, examples, and best practices in the open.

## How You Can Help

1. **[Join](https://agentcommunity.org)** – become a member and get early access to .agent domains. _(Join with your company!)_
2. **[Invite](https://agentcommunity.org)** – share your personal link, earn points, and grow the ecosystem.
3. **[Contribute](https://github.com/orgs/agentcommunity)** – comment. review, and propose new ideas.
4. **Build** – ship agents, get feedback and and wear the .agent badge.

### First Work Item: Agent Interface Discovery (AID)

Our starting task is **AID**, a lightweight DNS‑based protocol that lets any client discover an agent's endpoint and config with a single query. AID wipes out the "where is the API" problem and lays the groundwork for richer registry services.

## Community vs Registrar: Who Does What

| Platform               | Role                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AgentCommunity.org** | Community, standards, governance, education            |
| **AgentDomain.xyz**    | Future registrar portal for registering .agent domains |



## The Gap We Are Closing

Today agent developers face:

* **Trust** – anyone can spin up an endpoint, but users cannot tell if it is safe or honest.
* **Discovery** – there is no simple way to locate an agent's API or capabilities from its domain.
* **Interoperability** – competing schemas fragment the ecosystem and slow adoption.
* **Ethics** – few shared norms keep agents aligned with human interests.
* **Voice** – decisions often rest with big platforms, not with the builders on the ground.
